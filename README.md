# WebVS
WebVS is primarily an information gathering (Reconnisance) tool. It can be used to brute-force subdomains, directories, files and pages of websites by providing wordlists. It can also act as a spider and extract links and forms from a webpage or website by scanning recursively. The  extracted forms can later be used to check for **XSS** vulnerabilities. We can extend this tool in future to support **CSRF** and **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities.

### Features
